// Arrays actually store the data in linear contiguous
// in the memory of the computer in a single variable
// then it can be accessed based on the index of the item.

// KEY POINT TO REMEMBER 
// In JS, array support heterogenous data type in a single array
//Eg, let a =[1,2,3,true,"vasa",null]; different data type can co-exist together;


 
//How to create array in JS

let rollNum = []; //initialized an empty array

let y = [1,2,3,4,5]; //initialized array with value in it.

console.log(rollNum);
console.log(y);
